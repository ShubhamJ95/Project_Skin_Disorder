# Skin_Disorder

# Problem Statement
Task 1 :- Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.

Task 2 :- Create a predictive model using machine learning techniques to predict the various classes of skin disease.

Task 3 :- Suggestions to the Doctors to identify the skin diseases of the patient at the earliest.

# Objectives :
- The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for accurately diagnosing "erythemato-squamous" diseases based on clinical and histopathological features. These diseases, including psoriasis, seborrheic dermatitis, lichen planus, pityriasis rosea, chronic dermatitis, and pityriasis rubra pilaris, present similar clinical symptoms of erythema and scaling, making their differential diagnosis challenging. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to create a model that can differentiate between these diseases based on the provided features.

# Project Summary :
- During this evaluation, we assess various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score. This comparative analysis allow us to determine the effectiveness and efficiency of different classifiers in predicting erythemato-squamous based on the provided dataset. By systematically evaluating the performance metrics of each classifier, we can gain insights into their strengths and weaknesses.

- This information will aid in selecting the most suitable classifier for our specific task of erythemato-squamous prediction. This process contribute to the selection of a robust and accurate model for predicting erythemato-squamous in the given dataset. From the results, it can be observed that Random Forest model demonstrates the highest accuracy & F1 score of 0.981481. It also correctly classify the diseases with only 2 missclassifications. Hence, it can be concluded that Random Forest emerges as the preferred model for our dataset.

# Suggestions to the Doctors to identify the skin diseases of the patient at the earliest.

1) It's hard for the doctors to identify the skin diseases at earliest stage due to the need for the patients to consult the doctors first before being referred to the dermatologist. Prior to the dermatology clinic visit, most patients visit the doctors/health officers for the same complaints. A lack of dermatological training is an essential factor responsible for difﬁculties in diagnosing and managing skin diseases.

2) Dermatological diseases are one of the most common diseases to present and yet this group of diseases is often overlooked in medical education and training. This can be accomplished by improving medical schools’ curricula and providing lectures and workshops on common local dermatological conditions by dermatologists.

3) Additionally, doctors/health officers need to recognize the referral guidelines to avoid unnecessary referrals due to poor differentiation skills between benign and malignant skin conditions. This raises attention about the need for specialized training in such cases.

4) Apart from that, they need to be trained to perform screening examinations for such dermatological conditions to reach an early diagnosis and intervention, which in turn reduces the morbidity and mortality of such skin disorders.

# Challenges :
1) Small data : There are only 366 datas for this study hence it is difficult to accurately train and test the data.
 
2) Imbalanced data : The outputs for this data is imbalanced making it very easy for the training data only consists of the majority class.
 
3) Underfitting of training data : Since the data is small, data is unable to establish an accurate relationship between input and output variables. It signifies the data is too simple to establish a precise relationship.
